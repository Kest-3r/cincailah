# PeaceSpace– Mental Health Support App for Students


---

## Problem Statement
University students today face multiple challenges that directly affect their mental health and productivity. Academic workload, deadlines, financial concerns, and social pressures often result in stress, anxiety, and burnout. Many students also feel isolated or lonely when living away from family, and traditional support systems such as counseling services are often limited in capacity or difficult to access regularly.

Studies show that stress-related issues among students lead to decreased academic performance, poor emotional regulation, and even long-term health risks. While there are productivity apps and separate meditation tools available, there is no single companion that brings together **mental wellness + productivity support** specifically tailored for students.

This gap calls for an application that students can rely on every day as both a productivity tool and a supportive emotional outlet.

## Solution
PeaceSpace provides a **holistic digital wellness companion** tailored to university students. Instead of using separate apps for deadlines, journaling, and mindfulness, Eleanor brings them together in one platform.

Core values of Eleanor:
- Accessible: Always available in your pocket.
- Supportive: Acts as a daily companion, not just a tool.
- Engaging: Uses simple, interactive, and fun features like the relaxation bear and streak tracking.

With PeaceSpace, students can record their moods, manage deadlines, relax with guided activities, and share feelings anonymously. The app is designed to encourage **daily engagement** and help students maintain balance between study, rest, and personal well-being.
